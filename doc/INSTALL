The following is a brief overview of the building and installing instructions for Debian / Ubuntu.

For full instructions on how to build and install MotionPlus, see the motionplus_build.html that is
distributed with this source code. 

The packages and library names change frequently and vary across base operating systems.
Adjust the following lines as required by the base operating system.

Install basic build packages:
    sudo apt install autoconf automake autopoint build-essential pkgconf libtool libzip-dev
          libjpeg-dev git libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev libavdevice-dev
          libwebp-dev gettext libmicrohttpd-dev libmariadb-dev libasound2-dev libfftw3-dev

Once required packages are installed, execute:
    autoreconf -fiv
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Sample custom configuration options:
    --prefix               :  Specify the install location for the motionplus package
    --with-ffmpeg=[dir]    :  Specify the location in which ffmpeg/libav is installed.
